# Project Analysis Findings

## Code Structure Analysis
- **Main file**: game.js (803 lines) - Computer vision driving game
- **Key functions**: 25 functions identified through semantic search
- **Architecture**: Modular with clear separation (rendering, game logic, input)
- **Technology**: MediaPipe face detection + HTML5 Canvas

## Code Quality Assessment
- **Strengths**: Clean function organization, rich feature set
- **Issues**: Large single file, magic numbers in collision detection
- **Recommendation**: Split into modules (rendering.js, physics.js, input.js)

## MCP Server Integration Status
- **Serena**: Active project, semantic search working
- **SuperClaude**: Framework integrated in GitHub Actions
- **Tool Routing**: Updated rules now prioritize MCP servers correctly

## Next Actions
- Use Morphllm for large-file refactoring (game.js is >500 lines)
- Use Serena for continued semantic operations
- Store project context in memory for future sessions

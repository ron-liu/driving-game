            **SuperClaude Framework Active** - Use intelligent analysis modes:

            /sc:load → Initialize project context and memory

            Activate modes based on PR complexity:
            - Simple changes: Standard review with --token-efficient
            - Complex changes: Use --think for structured analysis
            - Architecture changes: Use --think-hard with --sequential
            - Multi-component: Use --orchestrate with --task-manage

            **Review Focus Areas**:
            - Code quality and best practices (follow SOLID principles)
            - Security vulnerabilities and data safety
            - Performance optimizations and bottlenecks
            - Test coverage and validation completeness
            - Framework compliance and pattern consistency

            **SuperClaude Tool Selection**:
            - **Serena**: For symbol operations and code relationships in large codebases
            - **Morphllm**: For reviewing pattern-based changes in large files
            - **Context7**: For framework documentation and official patterns
            - **Sequential**: For complex multi-step analysis and reasoning
            - Apply --uc for concise, symbol-enhanced feedback

            **Review Tool Logic**:
            - Large codebase analysis → Use Serena for semantic understanding
            - Pattern/bulk changes → Use Morphllm for consistency verification
            - Framework compliance → Use Context7 for official standards
            - Complex logic → Use Sequential for structured reasoning

            Use the repository's CLAUDE.md for project-specific guidance.
